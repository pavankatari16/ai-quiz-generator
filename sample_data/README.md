# Sample Data Documentation

This directory contains sample JSON outputs demonstrating the expected structure and format of API responses from the AI Quiz Generator backend.

## Files

### sample_quiz_1.json
Sample response from the `POST /generate_quiz` endpoint using an Artificial Intelligence Wikipedia article.

**Structure:**
- `id`: Unique quiz identifier (auto-generated by database)
- `url`: Source article URL
- `title`: Extracted title from the article
- `date_generated`: ISO 8601 timestamp
- `full_quiz_data`: JSON object containing:
  - `title`: Quiz title
  - `questions`: Array of 5 quiz questions, each with:
    - `question`: Question text
    - `choices`: Array of 4 answer choices
    - `answer`: Index (0-3) of the correct answer

### sample_quiz_2.json
Sample quiz generated from a Machine Learning Wikipedia article. Demonstrates quiz generation on a different topic.

### sample_quiz_3.json
Sample quiz generated from a Neural Networks Wikipedia article. Shows variety in question types and topics.

### history_response.json
Sample response from the `GET /history` endpoint showing an array of previously generated quizzes (truncated for brevity).

## Expected API Response Formats

### POST /generate_quiz
**Request:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing"
}
```

  {...quiz object...},
  {...quiz object...}
]
```

### GET /quiz/{quiz_id}
**Response:**
Same structure as POST /generate_quiz response (see sample_quiz_1.json)

## Using Sample Data

You can use these JSON files to:
1. **Test the frontend** without running the backend
2. **Mock API responses** in development
3. **Understand the expected data structure**
4. **Create integration tests**

## Data Structure Notes

- All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format with timezone info
- Quiz data is stored as JSON text in the database and parsed on return
- The `answer` field uses 0-based indexing for the correct choice
- Questions are pre-generated by the LLM (Gemini) or mock generator
- Each quiz contains exactly 5 questions
